## STREAMLINED NETWORKING INTEGRATION
The Streamlined Networking Integration project is a modular system for diagnosing and resolving network issues efficiently. It includes an AI-powered chatbot, troubleshooting modules, and performance monitoring tools for enhanced user experience. Built with Python (Flask), HTML & CSS and integrated hardware, it ensures accurate and scalable network management.

## About
Your project, **Streamlined Networking Integration**, is a **network troubleshooting system** designed to diagnose and resolve various **network issues** efficiently. Each network problem is treated as a **separate module**, covering issues like **DNS misconfiguration, IP routing anomalies, packet loss, and network performance monitoring**. The system integrates an **AI-powered chatbot**, similar to GPT, to help users understand and resolve network problems in real time. Additional features include a **library for saved modules, a history panel for tracking past diagnostics, notifications for updates, and customizable settings**.The project is developed using **Python (Flask) for backend processing, HTML & CSS for UI**, with hardware integration such as the **Alpha WiFi adapter** for network analysis. It is a **single-account system** with two user types: **Network Engineer and General User**. The project aims to provide **an intelligent, user-friendly, and scalable solution** for network management and troubleshooting. 

## Features

- Modular Network Issue Diagnosis.
- Scalable and Future-Ready
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
- A specific scope of Chatbot response model.

## Requirements

* Operating System: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
* Development Environment: The Streamlined Networking Integration project uses Python (Flask) for backend and HTML & CSS for UI, developed in VS Code or PyCharm. It supports Windows, Linux, and macOS, with Flask,
